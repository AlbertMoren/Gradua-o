'''Create a program that receives the amount of money in Brazilian reais that a person who is going to travel has. She will visit several countries and needs to convert her money into dollars, German marks, and British pounds. It is known that the exchange rate is $1.80 for one dollar, $2.00 for one German mark, and $3.57 for one British pound. The program should perform the conversions and display them.'''
