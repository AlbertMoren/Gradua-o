# Program that receives two numbers, calculates, and displays the division of the first number by the second. It is known that the second number cannot be zero, so there is no need to worry about validations.

# My signature
print("=+" * 28, "\n", " " * 20, "ALB System", "\n", "=+" * 28, "\n")

# Input two numbers
x = float(input("Enter a number: "))
y = float(input("Enter another number: "))

# Calculate and print the division
print(x / y)
