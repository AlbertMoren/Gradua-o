'''Make a program that fills an array with the names of seven students and loads another array with their final grades. Calculate and show:
 â–  the name of the student with the highest average (disregard ties);
 â–  for each student who didn't pass, that is, with an average lower than 7, show how much they need to score on the final exam to pass. Consider that the passing grade for the exam is 5.
